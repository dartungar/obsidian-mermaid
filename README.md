# Obsidian Mermaid
[Mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io) lets you create diagrams and visualizations using text:
```mermaid
A ---> B
```

Obsidian supports Mermaid.js natively, via `mermaid` codeblocks.

This plugin adds a panel with common Mermaid.js elements, so you won't have to remember them.
Click on an element to paste it into editor.

Note: in toolbar panel, all elements are wrapped as complete diagrams for rendering purposes.
